# Entropy-Calculation-of-Text-Using-Fortran
This repository contains a Fortran program that calculates the entropy of a text file. It reads the file, counts the occurrences of characters from a predefined alphabet (including letters and spaces), computes their probabilities, and calculates the entropy. The program also checks for invalid characters not in the defined alphabet.
